# LearnLoop UI

## Overview
LearnLoop is a Next.js-based learning platform that uses Google's Gemini AI to generate educational course content. The application features an interactive course builder with AI-powered content generation.

**Current State**: Successfully migrated from Vercel to Replit and running in production mode.

## Recent Changes
- **November 10, 2025 (Latest)**: Added gamified roadmap visualization for course journeys
  - Created GameifiedRoadmap component with Candy Crush/Byju's-style visual journey
  - Animated SVG path drawing connects module nodes in a winding, game-like path
  - Beautiful gradient nodes with Star (start), Zap (middle), Trophy (end) icons
  - Smooth spring animations: path drawing (2s), node pop-in (staggered 0.2s each)
  - Hover/focus effects reveal module details with glow animation
  - Fully keyboard accessible with proper ARIA labels and focus states
  - Progress stats cards showing total modules, topics, and difficulty level
  - Displays automatically after course generation with smooth reveal
  
- **November 10, 2025**: Enhanced UI with beautiful animated time cadence display
  - Created glassmorphic time cadence badge with smooth spring animations
  - Subtle breathing animation (gentle scale pulse every 4 seconds)
  - Hover effect with warm shadow glow matching brand colors
  - Value updates in real-time as you type in duration field
  - Moved "Generate course" button and status badge below input fields (right-aligned)
  - Added clear warning when Gemini API quota exceeded (>40s generation time)
  
- **November 10, 2025**: Fixed course generation status indicators and logging
  - Fixed status state race condition - "Course ready" indicator now displays for full 5 seconds
  - Added request ID correlation between frontend and backend for better debugging
  - Implemented concise structured logging with timing information
  - Verified course generation correctly uses user's topic and difficulty (both Gemini and fallback)
  - Status flow: idle → loading → done (5s) → idle
  
- **November 10, 2025**: Migrated project from Vercel to Replit
  - Configured Next.js to run on port 5000 with 0.0.0.0 binding for Replit compatibility
  - Set up development workflow with webview output
  - Configured deployment for Replit autoscale
  - Added allowedDevOrigins configuration for Replit domains
  - Installed dependencies with legacy peer deps flag (React 19 compatibility)

```

## Environment Variables

### Required Secrets
- `GEMINI_API_KEY`: Google Gemini API key for AI content generation (configured in Replit Secrets)

### Optional Configuration
- `GEMINI_MODEL`: Model to use (defaults to gemini-2.0-flash-exp)
- `GEMINI_MAX_TOKENS`: Maximum tokens per request (defaults to 2048)
- `GEMINI_TEMPERATURE`: Temperature for generation (defaults to 0.7)

## Development

### Running Locally
The development server runs automatically via the configured workflow:
- Port: 5000
- Host: 0.0.0.0 (accessible from Replit webview)
- Hot reload enabled

### Scripts
- `npm run dev`: Start development server on port 5000
- `npm run build`: Build for production
- `npm run start`: Start production server on port 5000
- `npm run lint`: Run ESLint

### Deployment
Configured for Replit autoscale deployment:
- Build command: `npm run build`
- Start command: `npm run start`
- Automatically scales based on traffic

## API Endpoints

### `/api/generate` (GET/POST)
- **GET**: Returns API status and available Gemini models
- **POST**: Generate content using Gemini AI
  - Request body: `{ prompt: string, maxTokens?: number, temperature?: number, model?: string }`
  - Returns: Generated content with model information and usage metadata

### `/api/course/generate`
Course generation endpoint

### `/api/course/test`
Course testing endpoint

## Known Issues & Notes
- Using `--legacy-peer-deps` for npm install due to React 19 and framer-motion compatibility
- TypeScript type checking disabled in build (`ignoreBuildErrors: true`) due to framer-motion/React 19 type incompatibilities - code works correctly at runtime
- YouTube integration available but API key not yet configured
- Turbopack panic in Next.js 16 is a known issue and doesn't affect functionality

## Debugging & Logging
- Course generation requests include correlation IDs (format: `req_TIMESTAMP_RANDOM`)
- Frontend logs: `[req_xxx] Course generation: Topic (difficulty)`
- Backend logs: `[req_xxx] Request: "Topic" (difficulty, duration)`
- Success logs: `[req_xxx] Success: "Course Title" (N modules, Xms)`
- Check browser console and server logs for the same request ID to trace issues
